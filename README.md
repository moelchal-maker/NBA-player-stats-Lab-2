Basketball Player Analysis Project

Purpose
This project analyzes NBA player statistics to provide insights for teams, coaches, players, and analysts. It calculates key performance metrics such as shooting accuracies, points per game, blocks, and steals for each player across seasons. The goal is to identify top performers in various categories, aiding in player recruitment, game strategy, injury prevention, and fan engagement.

The analysis uses a subset of data from a Kaggle repository containing NBA player stats from the 1999-2000 season.

#Design and Implementation
The project is implemented as a procedural Python script using NumPy for efficient vectorized calculations on large datasets. There are no classes; instead, functions and global variables handle data loading, metric computation, and output.
